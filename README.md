# Project Summary
Essensliebe is a website for matchmaking users based on their food preferences. It is a ‘going on a date’ kind of site that will allow users to find others with similar food liking. Once paired, the users will be given recommendations by the website as to where they can go to eat while keeping sure to supply them with restaurants that benefit their food and dietary preferences. They will also be able to chat, get to know and ask each other out on dates. It will do so by utilising its matchmaking algorithm functionalities, which are broken down into two major components; User matchmaking and Paired Users to Restaurant matchmaking.
